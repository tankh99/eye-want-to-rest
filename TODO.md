Note to future self:
- I've decided to just make a simple scroll picker since animations don't seem to be able to make the geometrical effect efficiently. The scroll picker will just be big enough to put one number. It won't be immediately obvious that the user can scroll, but that's good. I want it to look as natural as possible. Also, remember to replace the scrollview with the actual view when timer starts.
